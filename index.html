  <h1>WORKSHOP SUMMARY</h1>
  
  <p>While visualization research is still largely focused on data analysis, most people experience visualization as communication 
  and presentation. The New York Times and other publications regularly release interactive visuals depicting complex datasets 
  including political topics, budgets, and sports. An independent community of visualization practitioners and bloggers has also 
  sprung up, producing and deconstructing visualizations of data of broad interest. Free visualization tools such as D3, Data 
  Wrapper, Tableau Public, and others are available and widely used.</p>

  <p>The VisComm workshop brings together practitioners and researchers from a broad range of disciplines to address questions 
  raised by visualization’s new communicative role. We encourage participation from journalists, designers and others that do 
  not typically attend IEEE Vis.</p>

  <h1>DATE, TIME AND ONLINE ACCESS</h1>
  
  <p>The workshop will be held remotely and online on Sunday, October 25, 12pm to 3:30pm MDT 
  (<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=time+in+salt+lake+city">Salt Lake time</a>, or 18-2130 UTC). 
  To tranlate this into your local time, we suggest this <a href="https://www.thetimezoneconverter.com/">time converter</a>.</p>

    <em>Abstract:</em> Interaction enables users to effectively navigate large amounts of data, supports cognitive

  <h1>SUBMISSIONS</h1>

  <p>VisComm has four submission tracks: short papers (research or position), posters, and visual case studies.</p>

  <h2>Short Research Papers</h2>
 
  <p>Research papers between 2 and 6 pages long, with length matching content. Research papers will be reviewed 
  based on how well claims are supported by evidence. Submissions are expected to include all materials and data 
  needed to replicate and reproduce any figures, analyses, and methods. If anything cannot be publicly shared (e.g., 
  for data privacy concerns), state the reason in the paper.</p>

  <h2>Short Position Papers</h2>
 
  <p>We invite submission of position papers between 2 and 6 pages long, with length matching content. Position papers 
  are problem discussions or statements describing the author’s relevant experience and ideas with regards to methods 
  and methodologies for visualization research, and in particular the focus topic of the workshop. Position papers will 
  be selected according to their importance and relevance for the workshop topics and how well they will fit the planned 
  discussions.</p>

  <h2>Posters</h2>
 
  <p>We invite both late-breaking work and contributions in this area in the form of extended abstracts one to two 
  pages in length (plus an additional page for references), with an optional video.</p>

  <h2>Visual Case Studies</h2>
 
  <p>We invite practitioners to submit a one-page write-up together with a link to an online piece or a short video. 
  The write-up should explain what you made, why you made it, outcome/responses (both expected and unexpected), etc.</p>

  <p>The goal is to show the work of journalists, designers, people working for governments or non-profits, etc., who 
  use data to inform and communicate.</p>
